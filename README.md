### Chess Engine with Neural Network

This is a Python code that represents a simple chess engine using a neural network for valuation. The engine reads a dataset of chess games, trains a neural network on the positions in those games, and then uses this network to evaluate positions during gameplay.

# Chess Engine with Neural Network

## Introduction

This Python code implements a chess engine that utilizes a neural network for position valuation. The engine is designed to read a dataset of chess games, train a neural network on the positions from those games, and then use this network to evaluate positions during gameplay. The neural network is employed to estimate the value of a given board position, which is crucial for decision-making in chess.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [chess](https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/) library
- [torch](https://pytorch.org/) library
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/) library

Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install chess numpy torch Flask
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation:**

   Place your PGN (Portable Game Notation) files in the `data` folder. These files contain chess games.

2. **Data Processing:**

   Run the script `process_data.py` to parse the PGN files, generate training data, and save the processed dataset.

   ```bash
   python process_data.py
   ```

3. **Neural Network Training:**

   Train the neural network by running the script `train.py`.

   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

   The trained model will be saved as `nets/value.pth`.

4. **Chess Engine Web Application:**

   Run the Flask web application for playing chess against the engine.

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/) to play against the chess engine.

## Playing Against the Engine

- Start a new game by clicking on the "New Game" button.
- Make your moves by entering them in algebraic notation or by dragging and dropping pieces on the board.
- The engine will respond with its move, and the game continues.
